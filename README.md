# rmdup
A little program I wrote to clean up duplicate MP3 files that people keep giving me.

Supported parameters:

- -r		recurse through subdirectories
- -s		safe mode, don't actually remove any files
- -q		quiet mode, don't output anything
- -h		show help screen

Uses MD5 implementation from http://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/software/public-domain-source-code/md5
