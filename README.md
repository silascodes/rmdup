# rmdup
A little program I wrote to clean up duplicate MP3 files that people keep giving me.

Supported parameters:

-r		recurse through subdirectories
-s		safe mode, don't actually remove any files
-q		quiet mode, don't output anything
-h		show help screen

Uses MD5 implementation from http://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/software/public-domain-source-code/md5
